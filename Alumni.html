<p>The Spartan Alumni Rowing Association (S.A.R.A.) was formed in 2003 as the alumni group for Case Crew. SARA builds connections between rowing alumni and the current team members and parents through social events, alumni racing, sharing team information and fundraising. SARA is a separate 501(c)3 organization that helps Case Crew acquire boats &amp; equipment, pay for boathouse space and provide coaching.&nbsp; SARA has also funded a coaching endowment with the university to help us defray our <a href="http://www.spartanalumnirowing.org/giving/SARA_endowment_list.html" target="_blank">coaching costs.</a><br />
<br />
Key alumni events throughout the year are the Head of the Cuyahoga, Concept 2 January Team Challenge, Spring Alumni Regatta and Dinner and the Dad Vail Regatta.&nbsp; Any student that rowed for Case Crew is considered a member of SARA and receives regular communication about the crew and alumni.&nbsp; Numbering over 500 alumni members, SARA and Case Crew have become the preeminent collegiate rowing team in Northeast Ohio.
