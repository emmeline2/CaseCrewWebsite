<h4>FAQ</h4>

<h5>&quot;I&#39;ve never rowed before. Can I still join?&quot;</h5>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Of course! Most of our team had never been in a boat before college. We are looking for fit athletes with a competitive mindset. Case rowers come from all backgrounds,&nbsp;from&nbsp;track to football to marching band. The only hard requirement&nbsp;is a desire to challenge yourself and&nbsp;try something new.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h5>&quot;When do you practice?&quot;</h5>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;">Fall novice crews generally have on-the-water practice MWF at 6:00 P.M, and Saturdays in the A.M. Over the winter we begin to mix the varsity and novice together and practices move to the morning and increase in frequency in order to match the varsity workload.</span></p>

<h5>&quot;How will this affect my grades?&quot;</h5>

<p><span style="font-size:14px;">At Case Crew we are all students first and expect academic excellence from all our participants. Rowing, like any other involvement at CWRU,&nbsp;is a time commitment. But we have students from all majors see great success on and off the water with good time management and hard work.</span></p>
